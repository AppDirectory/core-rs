models:
- recursive (de)serialization (ie, Note and Note.File)
- PGP key generation and encryption
- key searching (keychain, board.keys, etc)
- old key format detection
- generate_subkeys
- encrypt_key / decrypt_key

sync:
- outgoing file uploads
- incoming file downloads
- notify UI of API -> core sync
- notify UI of sync/login status
- dispatch handlers for UI -> core sync
- effective way to test sync via tests or at least client?

profile:
- post-load indexing (load all notes and index in-mem via clouseau)
- reindex on item change
- dispatch handlers for grabbing/searching notes

invites/personas:
- anything special? or will sync+ui notifications handle all this?

general:
- binary exchange format? MessagePack? JSON requires base64 and is clunky

user:
- join

profile:
- fix stack overflow on larger profiles

sync:
- notify UI of API -> core sync
- notify UI of sync/login status
- notify core of UI data change
  - reindex on note change
- effective way to test sync via tests or at least client?
- outgoing file uploads
- incoming file downloads

models:
- PGP key generation and encryption
- move over tests from JS

invites/personas:
- anything special? or will sync+ui notifications handle all this?

general/future:
- get rid of rust-crypto/gcrypt, replace with either openssl or nettle
- come up with strategy to deprecate personas
- binary exchange format? MessagePack? JSON requires base64 and is clunky

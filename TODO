sync:
- load profile (keychain, boards, persona) after initial sync
- notify UI of API -> core sync
- notify UI of sync/login status
- dispatch handlers for UI -> core sync
- effective way to test sync via tests or at least client?
- outgoing file uploads
- incoming file downloads

models:
- create `Key` type to replace ambiguous Vec<u8>
- PGP key generation and encryption
- move over tests from JS

profile:
- post-load indexing (load all notes and index in-mem via clouseau)

  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2000567/sql-n-to-n-matching-multiple-values/2000642#2000642
- reindex on item change
- dispatch handlers for grabbing/searching notes

invites/personas:
- anything special? or will sync+ui notifications handle all this?

general/future:
- binary exchange format? MessagePack? JSON requires base64 and is clunky
- get rid of rust-crypto/gcrypt, replace with either openssl or nettle
- come up with strategy to deprecate personas

v0.7:
- add concept of spaces
- remove personas
- does subkey storage system make sense?
  - the "s"/"b" etc shit...can we restructure?
- get rid of sync.immediate
- no more boards owning boards.
- boards: pull keys from parent space
- notes: pull keys from parent space
- note must be in exactly one board
- send username/salt when joining
- only store space keys in keychain. everything else should be subkeys
- use libsodium for everything

- MsgPack for core <--> client comm

user:
- join
- password change
- email change

sync:
- track sync item failures via `freeze_sync_record`
- sync errors are now embedded in each failed sync item, no more passing errors
  to `notify_sync_failure`
- generic sync endpoint for various objects
  - add/edit/delete notes/boards/spaces/keychain/user/etc
- notify UI of API -> core sync
- notify UI of sync/login status
- notify core of UI data change
  - reindex on note change
- effective way to test sync via tests or at least client?
- outgoing file uploads
  - can we do this without queuing? perhaps a stateless query that says
    "here's all the notes w/ files i have, what are their file ids?"
	then compare the ids to what we have locally
- incoming file downloads
  - store files in filesystem (not sqlite)
  - filenames should be the <note.id>_<note.file.id>.enc

models:
- move over tests from JS

invites:
- NOTE: invite sending/accepting requires connection

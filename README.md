# Turtl core-rs

This is the Rust core for Turtl. It houses the logic for Turtl's main client
operations and is meant to be embedded as a shared/static library that is
standard across all platforms.

The idea is to house all of Turtl's core logic into one place that be run
anywhere.

This is made to talk to Turtl's new server (written in Nodejs, not yet public).

This project is unfinished and *alpha* status. I won't be responding to issues
or bug reports on it yet. Use at your own risk.
